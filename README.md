# strategy-data-analysis
Data analysis projects of Strategy Team, Bdjobs.com Limited. In this repo, I will be hosting my data analysis projects from Bdjobs.com ranging from identifying user behavior regarding job applications per month to defining the feasibility of new business plans. I am mostly using Python libraries for data processing and analyzing, which can be found in this repo and corresponding visualizations of this projects will be found in https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hamed07

## HP Analysis (Feature)
This project was done to figure out the impact of a application boosting feature and comparing the impacts of HP with basic applies and overall applies. I've used Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in this project and figured out HP applicants have 51% higher chances of being shortlisted compared to the basic applicants.

## Candidate Monetization
This project is associated with the new B2C business model, to determine the feasibility of reducing the number of free apply per month per user and imposing a payment option to avail more application per month. I have used Time Series forecasting, trend comparison of corresponding application segment, and EDA to figure out the purchasing behavior of users. This project is a high priority project as this can serve us both on the employer end and employee end by increasing revenue for the company and improving overall quality of applications. Reduced number of applications will enhance the overall quality of the applications per job post. It is found that approximately 24% of the users who reaches the reduced cap limit are expected to pay for more applications. 

Regression can be used if we decide to further dive deep into the project.
