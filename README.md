## HP Analysis (Feature)
This project was done to figure out the impact of a application boosting feature and comparing the impacts of HP with basic applies and overall applies. I've used Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in this project and figured out HP applicants have 51% higher chances of being shortlisted compared to the basic applicants.
